## Release Pipeline

- ✔ OIDC-based npm publishing (no secrets)
- ✔ Verified supply-chain provenance
- ✔ Automated quality gates (lint, test, audit)
- ✔ Reusable CI workflows

## Contributing / Branch protection

Direct pushes to `master` should be avoided. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` to enable the repo’s `pre-push` hook that blocks direct pushes to `master` locally.

  ## Release & Security Architecture

- Monorepo publishing with npm workspaces
- OIDC-based trusted publishing (no secrets)
- Canary & RC release channels
- SBOM generation (CycloneDX)
- CodeQL static analysis
- Dependabot automated updates

This pipeline enforces supply-chain integrity and production-grade quality gates.

# 🌎 Geo-Analytics API/Dashboard

**Geospatial Intelligence · Data Visualization · Operational Insight**

The **Geo-Analytics API/Dashboard** is a data-driven analytics platform designed to transform raw geographic and regional datasets into clear, actionable intelligence. It enables organizations to analyze performance by location, identify trends, and support strategic decision-making through interactive visualizations and automated data workflows.

This project reflects a traditional analytics discipline—**clean data in, meaningful insight out**—implemented with modern tooling and forward-looking design.

---

## 🎯 Purpose & Use Cases

This dashboard is built to answer questions executives and operators actually ask:

- Which regions are outperforming or underperforming?  
- How does demand, activity, or revenue vary geographically?  
- Where should resources, sales efforts, or infrastructure be prioritized?  
- How do regional trends evolve over time?  

### Ideal For
- Business intelligence & operations teams  
- Sales & marketing analytics  
- Logistics & territory planning  
- Public-sector or urban analytics  
- Portfolio and case-study demonstrations  

---

## 🧠 Core Features

### Geospatial Visualization
- Interactive regional maps (choropleths, markers, heat layers)  
- Location-based comparisons and drill-downs  

### Analytics & KPIs
- Region-level performance metrics  
- Trend analysis across time and geography  

### Automated Data Pipeline
- Data ingestion and transformation using Python  
- Structured outputs for repeatable analysis  

### Dashboard-Ready Outputs
- Clean datasets optimized for visualization layers  
- Exportable formats (**CSV / JSON**)  

### Scalable Architecture
- Modular design for future API integration  
- Ready for cloud deployment or embedding into BI tools
